```javascript
// Fallback riddles, trivia, puzzles automatically used when API unavailable
```

### Option 3: Try Alternative APIs
Consider other AI providers with free tiers:
- OpenAI (has free credits for new users)
- Anthropic Claude
- Google Gemini
- Hugging Face Inference API

## 📈 Usage Estimates

For gaming platform usage:
- **Light usage** (10 games/day): ~$1-2/month
- **Moderate usage** (50 games/day): ~$5-10/month  
- **Heavy usage** (200+ games/day): ~$20-50/month

Compare this to local deployment cost (electricity + hardware amortization).

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

Your E.Vol platform intelligently handles API availability:

```javascript
// Automatic fallback logic
try {
  // Try local AI server first (if running)
  result = await generateWithLocalAI(gameType);
} catch (localError) {
  try {
    // Fallback to DeepSeek API
    result = await generateWithAPI(gameType);
  } catch (apiError) {
    // Ultimate fallback to pre-written content
    result = getFallbackContent(gameType);
  }
}
```
